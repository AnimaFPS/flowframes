1) Download the 7z file with "-Full" if you want all dependencies (Python/Pytorch, etc) included, or the file with "-NoPython" if you already have a system pytorch installation, or if you have an AMD GPU that can't use pytorch anyway
2) Extract the 7z file using 7zip or any other program that supports it
3) Run Flowframes.exe

If you updated from an older version, you can optionally copy "FlowframesData/config.ini" to your new installation if you want to keep your settings.
You can delete your old installation after updating.

IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED TO OVERWRITE YOUR OLD INSTALLATION!
Instead, delete it first or install the new one to a different/empty folder.
