1) Download...
   - FF-Slim if you have an AMD/Intel GPU, or if you have an Nvidia GPU and Pytorch already installed
   - FF-Full if you have an Nvidia Turing (RTX 2000) or older GPU
   - FF-Full-RTX3000 if you have an Nvidia Ampere (RTX 3000) GPU. Also compatible with older GPUs, but has bigger filesize.

2) Extract the 7z file using 7zip or any other program that supports it

3) Run Flowframes.exe




If you updated from an older version, you can optionally copy "FlowframesData/config.ini" to your new installation if you want to keep your settings.
You can delete your old installation after updating.

IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED TO OVERWRITE YOUR OLD INSTALLATION!
Instead, delete it first or install the new one to a different/empty folder.
